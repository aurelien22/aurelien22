### Hello there ! My name is Aurélien Dincuff 👋😄

After studies in IT when I was 20, I became co-manager of a thalassotherapy stable with my wife for years.
That was a facinating period where I can develop many of skills useful to manage a company but at the beginning of 2020, I decide to retrieve my field of predilection : 👨‍💻 Computer science.

I'm working to be a Full-stack developer and I enjoy discovering new technologies and possibilities but I decided to specialise in : 

Back-end :

  - PHP
  - JAVA
  - Javascript / TypeScript
  - Symfony / API Platform
  - Spring boot

Front-end :

  - HTML5, CSS3 
  - Javascript / TypeScript
  - TailWindCSS
  - ReactJS

Mobile : React Native


However, I hope to get abilities in :

  - NoSQL databases, GraphQL, ...
